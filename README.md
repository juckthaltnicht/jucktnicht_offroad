    [1] = -1, -- Sedans
    [2] = -1, -- SUVs
    [3] = -1, -- Coupes

Config.CustomOffRoadLimits = { 
    ["t20"] = 50,
    ["adder"] = 40,
}

## üéØ Motivation
This script was created in response to overpriced alternatives on the market. The idea came from seeing similar systems being sold for high prices, such as [this one](https://pruda-scripts.tebex.io/package/6472654). I believe such a simple functionality should be freely available to the community!

## üõ†Ô∏è Support & Development
If you have any questions or want to contribute to further development, feel free to create an issue or pull request!

Enjoy the script! üöÄ
